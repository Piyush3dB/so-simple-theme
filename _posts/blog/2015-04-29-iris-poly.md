The [Iris flower dataset](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) is a miltidimensional dataset in $$\mathbb{R}^{4}$$ consisting of 50 samples each from 3 species of Iris flower.  A typical problem with this data is to classify the 3 species using the measured features such that they are clearly distinguished from each other.

Here I describe a method of transforming this 4 dimensional dataset into new parameter space in $$\mathbb{C}^{1}$$ for the purposes of visualising any structure that may be present in the data.  The idea is to project the data onto fourier bases using the Discrete Fourier Transform:

$$
F[n] = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} f[k]e^{-j\frac{2 \pi}{N} nk}
$$  

where $$ k \in [0,N-1]$$ and $$N $$ is the dimensionality of the data being transformed.


One advantage of the transformstion is based on the Parseval's theorem, which indicates that the information through transformation from the data space into the new parameter space is preserved, and information that can be deduced in the hyperdimensional original space can be easily deduced in the new parameter space. This duality empowers the discovery of correlated records, clusters and outliers based on each curve's intersections, gaps and isolations, respectively.

By the nature of the DFT, $$ F[n] $$ is complex which means one can construct plots of it's magnitude as a function of frequency, or alternatively a plot of it's real and imaginary parts on seperate axes.

A plot of $$ \lvert F[n] \rvert $$ against $$ \omega $$:

A plot of $$ Im(F[n]) $$ against $$ Re(F[n]) $$ i.e. the argand diagram:

</figure>

This is just one way of arranging the points in the data space prior to the transformation, and we note there are $$ ^{4}P_{4} = \frac{4!}{(4-4)!} = 24 $$ possible ways to project each data point onto the fourier bases.  Plotting all these permutations we get:

<figure class="centre">

	<a href="/images/ifpPhsAll.png"><img src="/images/ifpPhsAll.png" alt="image"></a>
	<figcaption>[red=setosa, blue=versicolor, green=virginica]</figcaption>
</figure>

We note the following:

1.  A subgroup of data is characterized by a set of simular curves.

2.  Permutations of variables play an important role in the clustering of similar groups of curves.


Other transformations can be performed to improve the visual presentation and clustering of similar curves, for instance normalising each input sample point to a constant.  The second column shows the result with this transformation:

<figure class="half">
	<a href="/images/ifpMagAll.png"><img src="/images/ifpMagAll.png" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="/images/ifpMagAllN.png"><img src="/images/ifpMagAllN.png" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="/images/ifpPhsAll.png"><img src="/images/ifpPhsAll.png" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="/images/ifpPhsAllN.png"><img src="/images/ifpPhsAllN.png" alt="image"></a>
	<figcaption>[red=setosa, blue=versicolor, green=virginica]</figcaption>
</figure>

In summary, the curves show an underlying structure in the data, with setosa more distinguishable from the other two species.  Depending on the permutation, versicolor and virginica can be distinguished so long as the clusters do not overalap throughout the entire parameter space.
