As a power Matlab user I sometimes find writing equivalent statements in Python Numpy rather unnatural.

Say for example I would like to create an array of numeric data by selecting data falling within the range `[7, 15]` from another array.  In Matlab, I would do this:


~~~ matlab
y = x(x>=7 & x<=15)
~~~

Because logical operations in Numpy require invoking a special function, the equivalent expression in Python would be:

~~~ python
y = x[np.logical_and(x>=7, x<=15)].
~~~

So `np.logical_and()` computes the element-wise truth values of `(x>=7) & (x<=15)`, which is fair enough but not as compact.
