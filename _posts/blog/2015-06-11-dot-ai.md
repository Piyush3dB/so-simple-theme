Over the coming weekend I shall be parking my `.london` domain in favour of a new `.ai` extension as `http://3db.ai` is a better fit with my interests in Signal Processing and Machine Learning and overall long term ambitions with this.  My blog can still be reached via GitHub pages on [http://Piyush3dB.github.io](http://Piyush3dB.github.io) but `.london` will cease to work.
