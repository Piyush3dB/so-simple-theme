There is a [new Big Data Journal](https://www.ieee.org/membership-catalog/productdetail/showProductDetailPage.html?product=PER472-ELE) to be published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) later this year and they're currently accepting papers for review.

> The IEEE Transactions on Big Data publishes peer reviewed articles with big data as the main focus. The articles will provide cross disciplinary innovative research ideas and applications results for big data including novel theory, algorithms and applications. Research areas for big data include, but are not restricted to, big data analytics, big data visualization, big data curation and management, big data semantics, big data infrastructure, big data standards, big data performance analyses, intelligence from big data, scientific discovery from big data security, privacy and legal issues specific to big data. Applications of big data in the fields of endeavor where massive data is generated are of particular interest.

I'm quite looking forward to this given the quality of papers accepted for publication, not least of which is the IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing has the highest Eigenfactor score.
