These two charts standout to me as guides for selecting the right ML algorithm depending on the problem.  This one is from the SciKit Learn:

The second comes from the DLib C++ library:

Choosing the best approach really depends on the problem and in some cases there isn't a best usually one answer, but rather a solution that combines different ideas in ways that would appear to overlap (or for that matter not appear) in the charts.
