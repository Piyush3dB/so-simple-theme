The Brownian motion process is a common model for Phase Noise in telecommunications systems.  In a system with phase noise and an Intermediate Frequency Filter in the signal processing chain, one would be interested in the process of the signal after filtering.

Let $$s(t)$$ be a signal corrupted by phase noise.  Normalised to a unit amplitude, $$s(t)$$ can be written as

$$
s(t)=e^{j\phi(t)} 
$$

where $$\phi(t)$$ has zero mean and variance $$Dt$$.   $$D$$ represents the phase-diffusion coefficient of the noise source.  As such $$\phi(t)$$ can be modelled as a Brownian motion process

$$
\phi(t) = \sqrt{D} \int\limits_0^t dW(\tau) 
$$

where $$dW(t)$$ is a zero mean white noise process. Signal $$s(t)$$  is subject to a filter with kernel $$h(t)$$ , which is a convolution

$$
z(t) = s(t) \star h(t) = \int\limits_0^t h(\tau) e^{j \phi(t-\tau)} d\tau = \int\limits_0^t h(\tau) e^{j \phi(\tau)} d\tau
$$

Note that in the above equation we have replaced $$\phi(t-\tau)$$  with $$\phi(\tau)$$ , which is possible because $$\phi(t)$$ is a random process and so it’s ordering does not affect the statistics of $$z(t)$$. Expanding the above expression into $$\sin$$ and $$\cos$$ parts we get

$$
z(t) = \int\limits_0^t h(\tau) \cos( \phi(\tau)) d\tau + j\int\limits_0^t h(\tau) \sin( \phi(\tau)) d\tau
$$

Clearly $$z(t)$$ is composed of a real part and an imaginary part, which we can call $$x(t)$$  and $$y(t)$$ respectively, so that $$r(t) = \sqrt{x(t)^2+y(t)^2}$$ and $$\theta(t) = \tan^{-1}\left[ \frac{y(t)}{x(t)} \right]$$

$$
z(t) = x(t) + jy(t) = r(t) e^{j\phi (t)} = r(t)\cos(\phi (t))+j r(t)\sin(\phi (t))
$$

By comparing the two expressions for $$z(t)$$ we see that

$$
x(t) = \int\limits_0^t h(\tau) \cos( \phi(\tau)) d\tau 
$$

$$
y(t) = \int\limits_0^t h(\tau) \sin( \phi(\tau)) d\tau
$$

Here $$x(t)$$, $$y(t)$$ and $$z(t)$$ are not markov processes.  However, we have a system of equations for $$d\phi(t)$$, $$dx(t)$$ and $$dy(t)$$, which as a three component system form a markov vector process.  The resulting SDEs for Phase Noise are

$$
\left[\begin{array}{c} d\phi(t)\\ dx(t)\\ dy(t)\\ \end{array}\right] =\left[\begin{array}{c} 0\\ h(t)\cos (\phi(t))\\ h(t)\sin (\phi(t))\\ \end{array}\right] dt+\left[\begin{array}{c} \sqrt{D}\\ 0\\ 0\\ \end{array}\right] dW(t) 
$$

with initial conditions

$$
\phi(0)=0
$$

$$
x(0)=0
$$

$$
y(0)=0
$$
