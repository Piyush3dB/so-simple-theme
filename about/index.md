This blog is my take on Machine Learning in the context of Information Theory and Signal Processing.

The title is inspired by a â€œmathematical constant" in the theory of signal detection and analysis.  3 decibels corresponds to half the power of a signal:

$$20\log_{10}\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \Longleftrightarrow 10\log_{10}\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)$$

In bandwidth measurements, the 3dB points are taken as the limits for upper and lower cutoff frequencies.  This is because a 50% drop in power is a sufficient condition for most signal processing algorithms to cope with.
